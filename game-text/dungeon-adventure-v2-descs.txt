0x20b  /  0x2e61  : within a circle of distorted monoliths, etched into grotesque figures by the acid rain. Lightning arcs overhead, revealing the stark horror of this haunted place, while thunder echoes from every crag

0x21c  /  0x3104  : in a stone left ear. Paths lead west and into the rock

0x222  /  0x31ac  : in the roc's nest, where it brings "food" for storage
0x223  /  0x31cd  : south of the river, on the edge of a vast field of poppies which stretches west as far as the eye can see. A somnolent perfume hangs heavy on the breeze
0x224  /  0x3220  : on an east-west road, south of the river and north of a steep, treeless hill
0x225  /  0x3241  : on an east-west road beside the river and north of a flat grassy plain. A line of stepping stones leads to a small island in the water
0x226  /  0x327f  : on a mud-bank, north of a wide river. A stone bridge spans the waters, reaching from the granite cliffs above to the flat lands of the far bank, and a path climbs up to it
0x227  /  0x32db  : under the killer-willow tree
0x228  /  0x32ea  : on the southern end of a small island, reached by stepping stones from the south. The far end of the island is occupied by an angry-looking willow tree with six long rubbery branches
0x229  /  0x334c  : on stepping stones leading north to an island
0x22a  /  0x3362  : on the floor of a cavern, beside a clump of evil green toadstools. Liquid slime blocks the way north, but paths lead south and up
0x22b  /  0x33a4  : in the middle of the floor of a giant cove, in a giant ants' nest. Small footprints lead north and south
0x22c  /  0x33d4  : north of the cave floor, below a huge grey mushroom
0x22d  /  0x33ed  : at the end of an aqueduct designed to drip water evenly into the depths of a deep pit below. The aqueduct leads north, a narrow fissure leads south, and steps lead down into the pit
0x22e  /  0x3447  : walking on the bed of an empty aqueduct which crosses a vast dark pit
0x22f  /  0x346d  : in a damp north-south pipe
0x230  /  0x347a  : on an aqueduct
0x231  /  0x3484  : in a paved tunnel below a silver pedestal. Water trickles from a silver hoop painted on one wall and seeps south. An armoured door leads east and a crack splits the north wall
0x232  /  0x34dd  : standing in shallow water at the foot of the ramp. A ladder slopes northwards to a higher part of the ramp
0x233  /  0x350c  : on a wide spiral ramp which descends clockwise round an immense pit. A small dark tunnel leads north. But these are matters of little significance for the north wall of the tunnel is covered with a myriad moving images of writhing tormented creatures and your gaze is locked on them. Your sanity is draining away!! If you don't act quickly your soul will be captured by the wall
0x234  /  0x35d4  : on the ramp which descends clockwise around the edges of a very deep pit. To the east is an opening into a red-gold room
0x235  /  0x3611  : on the ramp, beside a doorway with small holes up one edge

0x23a  /  0x3669  : on the ramp, outside a long room with scratches on floor and ceiling
0x23b  /  0x3688  : on the ramp. A hand sign points into a narrow opening

0x23d  /  0x36cc  : on the ramp, outside a rubbery doorway

0x23f  /  0x36ec  : on the ramp, outside an opening to a pale room
0x240  /  0x36fe  : on the ramp, outside an evil dark entrance
0x241  /  0x3712  : on the ramp. A ladder slopes southwards to a lower part of the ramp
0x242  /  0x372f  : on the ramp. A sign over a doorway reads: "Congratulations! You have won a uniquely valuable reward! Just walk in and answer a simple question to claim your prize!"
0x243  /  0x378c  : You are on deadly slime, slipping towards the edge of the ramp

0x244  /  0x37ab  : on the ramp outside an ornate entrance. The ramp above looks dodgy
0x245  /  0x37ce  : on the ramp. A doorway bears the following message: "To escape the dungeon, collect 9 gems and go through this door. Leaving without the gems will cause your death". Clearly you must be in the central dungeon of the Demon Lord!
0x246  /  0x384d  : on the ramp, outside a doorway
0x247  /  0x3858  : on the ramp
0x248  /  0x385c  : on a massive spiral ramp which twists down into dark waters and up into the gloom above. Sea-spray wafts from a nearby doorway

0x250  /  0x39b5  : standing on a small round platform surrounded by a cylinder of silvery light

0x256  /  0x3aa4  : in the middle of the wight house, below a blue pedestal

0x258  /  0x3ae2  : in the southwest corner
0x259  /  0x3aec  : in the middle of the south wall of the wight house. A musty alcove opens behind you

0x25b  /  0x3b21  : in the crypt, beside a rotting coffin
0x25c  /  0x3b35  : in a long throne room lined with skin. There is a large doorway in the middle of each wall and a central granite throne

0x262  /  0x3bdd  : on a steep flight of stairs

0x264  /  0x3c23  : in a cylindrical room with eight exits, hewn from the rock. A pride of lions is carved over the north door and a red pedestal stands in the middle of the floor
0x265  /  0x3c73  : dead-end room, painted matt black. You'll have to return the way you came
0x266  /  0x3c98  : in a second dead-end black room
0x267  /  0x3ca8  : at the west of a long room with many pillars. The only exit is at the other end

0x269  /  0x3cf6  : in an empty stable with exits to east and west
0x26a  /  0x3d0d  : in a rough-hewn store room, filled by a haystack
0x26b  /  0x3d28  : at a junction in a steeply sloping u-shaped passage which leads northeast and northwest. Three round rocks protrude beside an opening to the east

0x270  /  0x3de8  : in the lower chamber. There are 6 exits

0x272  /  0x3e32  : in a round passage, blocked by a huge immovable stone which is covered by a pattern of swirling grooves. An orange pedestal stands in the centre of the NE-SW passage
0x273  /  0x3e8c  : at a tight junction above a narrow pit
0x274  /  0x3ea3  : in a tall cavern with a large central fireplace and a wide brick chimney leading upwards. There are openings all around
0x275  /  0x3ee8  : in an oppressive chimney
0x276  /  0x3ef9  : outside a glowing alcove
0x277  /  0x3f04  : at a blockage in the chimney
0x278  /  0x3f14  : in a dry north-south fissure, apparently blocked at the southern end
0x279  /  0x3f36  : at the end of a long east-west corridor lined with worn flagstones. A yellow pedestal stands in the middle of the road and doorways lead north and south

0x27b  /  0x3f92  : at the junction where the corridor ends

0x27e  /  0x3fee  : in a filthy, dead-end cell
0x27f  /  0x3ffc  : in a filthy, dead-end cell

0x282  /  0x4026  : in a filthy, dead-end cell
0x283  /  0x4034  : in a filthy, dead-end cell
0x284  /  0x4042  : in a crude narrow east-west corridor, hacked out of the rock
0x285  /  0x405f  : at a junction between north-south and east-west passages
0x286  /  0x407c  : beside a rockfall which blocks the passage
0x287  /  0x4090  : in the armoury. The weapons have rusted away, leaving stains on walls and floor
0x288  /  0x40bc  : in a looted toolroom
0x289  /  0x40c6  : in an empty store-cave
0x28a  /  0x40d4  : climbing a flight of narrow, cramped steps

0x28c  /  0x40f8  : in a giant, vacant, rats nest
0x28d  /  0x410a  : in a damp, musty north-south corridor
0x28e  /  0x411b  : clinging to a rock-face
0x28f  /  0x412a  : on a wide ledge half-way up the south side of a tall cave. Steps lead up and down. Several small, brightly patterned, psychedelic mushrooms grow at the back of the ledge
0x290  /  0x4188  : clinging to crumbling steps up the rock wall
0x291  /  0x41a0  : on a magnificent golden pathway running north-south through the air
0x292  /  0x41c5  : on a narrow ledge between the splendid golden pathway and a narrow tunnel
0x293  /  0x41f1  : in a narrow north-south passage through the rock. A peculiar sweet smell emerges from an opening to the west
0x294  /  0x4226  : in the troll's squalid store room, amidst junk of every kind. Astrological symbols and slogans cover the walls and a cloying incense smell clogs your nostrils. The only exit is east, between clumps of tasty pink mushrooms. The troll is slumped in a stupor in one corner
0x295  /  0x42b7  : on a wide ledge outside a tunnel entrance. A wooden bridge leads north across a deep cavern and steps lead up and down
0x296  /  0x42f8  : on a sturdy bridge across a cave
0x297  /  0x430a  : on a wide ledge between a sturdy bridge and a fissure in the rock. You keep bumping into objects that you can't see
0x298  /  0x4349  : in a small fissure that narrows as it winds north
0x299  /  0x4361  : crawling through tiny cracks which lead west and south
0x29a  /  0x437f  : in the strong room. An iron door leads west and a narrow crack splits the east wall
0x29b  /  0x43a9  : on cliff steps, broken by rock-falls
0x29c  /  0x43c0  : south a vast cavern floor, beside some small grey mushrooms. Tiny footprints lead north
0x29d  /  0x43f1  : in a viewing gallery over a deep pit. A chute leads down
0x29e  /  0x4410  : below a sign "Your fate is sealed! Your only hope is to descend into the Central Dungeon and collect 9 of its gems. Succeed and you will be free!"
0x29f  /  0x4461  : in a dead-end dark room
0x2a0  /  0x446d  : in a dead-end dark room, below a black pedastal
0x2a1  /  0x4486  : in a treasure chamber
0x2a2  /  0x4491  : in the west crusher room beside a door into a treasure chamber
0x2a3  /  0x44ac  : in the east crusher room beside an opening back to the ramp
0x2a4  /  0x44c6  : in a circular room of red-gold metal.
Gold rings cover the floor
0x2a5  /  0x44eb  : in a dead end, below a gallows tree from which a bloodless corpse hangs by one foot
0x2a6  /  0x4519  : on the brink of a deep, dark pit

0x2ac  /  0x45a0  : in the box room
0x2ad  /  0x45a8  : in the condemned cell. The only way out is to go west
0x2ae  /  0x45c3  : in the guard room. An exit leads north
0x2af  /  0x45d4  : in the "Skinner box": a blank room with no way out - just nine buttons in a vertical line up one wall. The buttons are numbered 1 to 9 and a discrete notice reads "choose the best"
0x2b0  /  0x463b  : in the reward room. This is empty too and has only 5 numbered buttons, labelled as follows...
 1: Great wealth;
 2: Eternal life;
 3: World peace;
 4: Mystery prize;
 5: Nothing.
A sign invites you to choose your prize
0x2b1  /  0x46c7  : in the statue room. An incomprehensible abstract sculpture of hoops, spirals and loops sprawls around on a small circular platform in the middle of the floor. The entrance is to the west
0x2b2  /  0x4726  : in an ornate, dead-end room
0x2b3  /  0x4733  : in the "Exit" chamber. You seem to have survived the Central Dungeon! There is only one way out...

0x2b5  /  0x4776  : in an empty room
0x2b6  /  0x477e  : in a treasure vault. A low crawl leads west

0x2b8  /  0x47b0  : 696
0x2b9  /  0x47b4  : 697
0x2ba  /  0x47b8  : 698
0x2bb  /  0x47bc  : 699
0x2bc  /  0x47c0  : on the ceiling of a fine room. A chandelier lies beside you and the floor of the room is far above
0x2bd  /  0x47eb  : on the carpetted floor of a comfortable homely room, beside a door to the east.
0x2be  /  0x4810  : in a large store room. You realise that this is the ideal place to leave any treasures that you find, so as to get full points for them. Doors lead west and to the outside. A machine resembling a six-foot cube with a single red button sits in one corner
0x2bf  /  0x4899  : in a smooth, round north-south passage. A flickering light is visible to the north
0x2c0  /  0x48bb  : at a junction in the round, north-south passage, illuminated by a jet of flame from the floor.
To the east is a treasure vault, completely filled with valuables of every kind
0x2c1  /  0x4919  : in a north-south passage. A dry red stain spreads from beneath a fallen stone
0x2c2  /  0x493f  : in a hot alcove, lit by the flames of a fire elemental
0x2c3  /  0x495b  : in a huge cave of glistering rock. New passages lead north and south
0x2c4  /  0x497a  : in a corridor bending south and east
0x2c5  /  0x4987  : at the bottom of a deep chasm where the earth has been split asunder by a massive explosion. Narrow cracks lead west and down
0x2c6  /  0x49cc  : in the right eye-socket of the stone face
0x2c7  /  0x49e2  : in the left eye-socket of the stone face
0x2c8  /  0x49f8  : in a wide, smelly passage opening to the outside, high above the river
0x2c9  /  0x4a1d  : in a winding, sticky east-west passage to the outside
0x2ca  /  0x4a36  : in a winding, sticky east-west passage to the outside
0x2cb  /  0x4a4f  : inside a large wooden box. A small door leads deeper into the box
0x2cc  /  0x4a71  : in a gloomy cavern, between rows of jagged, pointed stalagmites. A fetid odour drifts from a wide round passage to the north
0x2cd  /  0x4ab4  : 717
0x2ce  /  0x4ab8  : 718
0x2cf  /  0x4abc  : 719
0x2d0  /  0x4ac0  : in Valhalla
0x2d1  /  0x4ac8  : in Hades
0x2d2  /  0x4acf  : You fall headlong into a deep pit...
0x2d3  /  0x4ae4  : No way! The water is full of piranha fish!
0x2d4  /  0x4afb  : in Limbo
0x2d5  /  0x4b03  : in the repository for bugs
0x2d6  /  0x4b13  : A hollow voice intones: "This is your referee speaking. If you continue on this road you will return safe to civilisation and the game will end. Are you sure that you want to?"

0x2d7  /  0x4b78  : 
0x2d8  /  0x4b79  : The ground is too slippery!
0x2d9  /  0x4b88  : 
0x2da  /  0x4b89  : The rings dodge
0x2db  /  0x4b94  : The ring grabs your finger and grows rapidly..
You shrink rapidly..
0x2dc  /  0x4bbc  : A flying hand throttles you
0x2dd  /  0x4bcc  : The ring lands in the hand room. You hear a struggle, then silence
0x2de  /  0x4beb  : 
0x2df  /  0x4bec  : 
0x2e0  /  0x4bed  : 
0x2e1  /  0x4bee  :
