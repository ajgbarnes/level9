0x15a  /  0x1dc3  : The cat scuffles about, cleaning

0x15b  /  0x1dd7  : It completely cleans the ramp
0x15c  /  0x1de6  : The ramp is coated in unislime
0x15d  /  0x1df5  : The cat sucks up

0x165  /  0x1f3c  : a comprehensive technical library with millions of entries
0x166  /  0x1f61  : the ship to be undamaged
0x167  /  0x1f70  : that the Snowball has veered off course. It's heading for the sun
0x168  /  0x1f8e  : all droid positions
0x169  /  0x1f99  : that all 1,800,000 passengers are well
0x16a  /  0x1fb3  : an impenetrable filing system
0x16b  /  0x1fc5  : a page-a-day diary. The author was worried about "Alpha"
0x16c  /  0x1fea  : a map of the Snowball: engine unit at the front, towing a great hollow ice-asteroid
0x16d  /  0x2016  : maps of the 10 great freezer disks
0x16e  /  0x202a  : the accommodation dome embedded in the south of asteroid wall
0x16f  /  0x204c  : the engine unit: four motors round a vast bay below the control room
0x170  /  0x206f  : a lengthy message querying the Snowball's flight plan
0x171  /  0x208a  : a worried message about two crew-members who seem to be missing
0x172  /  0x20af  : "Help! Alpha is battering down the door"..
0x173  /  0x20c8  : "Transmission u/s"
0x174  /  0x20d7  : It becomes brighter
0x175  /  0x20e1  : The screen changes to show 
0x176  /  0x20ee  : The screen shows 
0x177  /  0x20f7  : The screen flickers as you look
0x178  /  0x210a  : . Then you return to the menu
0x179  /  0x211b  : A massive waldroid guards the ladder
0x17a  /  0x212c  : A figure with a petrol bomb stands at the west of the room 
0x17b  /  0x214a  : The room is on fire!
0x17c  /  0x2155  : The blaze intensifies
0x17d  /  0x2162  : The fire blazes fiercely
0x17e  /  0x2171  : Flames are melting the walls
0x17f  /  0x2181  : The robot blocks you
0x180  /  0x218d  : You slip and fall
0x181  /  0x2197  : A laser blast spears out
0x182  /  0x21a6  : Burning petrol engulfs you
0x183  /  0x21b6  : It plays a scale, from low notes to very high
0x184  /  0x21d0  : . The petrol bomb shatters, surrounding its owner in fire. She staggers back through a hidden airlock - you will not see her again!
0x185  /  0x2218  : The tray reflects a laser beam back on itself. You hear an explosion
0x186  /  0x223d  : Carbon dioxide roars out
0x187  /  0x224c  :  and kills the fire
0x188  /  0x2259  : Paint puffs from the can
0x189  /  0x2267  : 
The paint blinds the robot which staggers away
0x18a  /  0x2281  : Snowball IX explodes!
0x18b  /  0x228d  : "Keep back or I throw the bomb!"
0x18c  /  0x22a2  : "You cannot get to the controls!"
0x18d  /  0x22b6  : "You won't stop me!"
0x18e  /  0x22c4  : The flask joins invisibly with the helmet, recharging its air
0x18f  /  0x22e7  : You feel a surge of acceleration
0x190  /  0x22f9  :  400
0x191  /  0x22fe  : at a junction of monomol ropes. Some look negotiable
0x192  /  0x2319  : in the web
0x193  /  0x231e  : at a junction
0x194  /  0x2326  : at a junction in the web. Plasteel ropes lead away
0x195  /  0x233d  : at a web junction. Ropes lead in many directions

0x1a4  /  0x23c4  : at a junction of the web
0x1a5  /  0x23cc  : at a junction of the web
0x1a6  /  0x23d4  : on a rope joining solid ice. It fans out as it enters the snow
0x1a7  /  0x23f7  : floating in space
0x1a8  /  0x2401  : in space near the inner surface of the hollow snowball protecting the freezers
0x1a9  /  0x242c  : about to hit the fast moving ice-below. You'd better match velocities..
0x1aa  /  0x2455  : on a flat snowfield north of an immense unclimbably smooth cliff. A pylon stands nearby
0x1ab  /  0x2487  : on trodden snow between a tall pylon and a hemidome calling itself the "Snowball Hilton"
0x1ac  /  0x24b7  : on churned and rutted snow below a tall pylon
0x1ad  /  0x24d0  : beside the northern ice-cliff which has a tiny cave at its base. A pylon stands nearby
0x1ae  /  0x2502  : on smooth snow beside a pylon, dwarfed by the north cliff
0x1af  /  0x251e  : on trampled snow outside a major snowdesic dome. Brilliant light from an entrance split in the hemidome illuminates a nearby pylon
0x1b0  /  0x2569  : on smooth snow, beside one of a chain of pylons. A ladder leads up the pylon to a cabin
0x1b1  /  0x258d  : on soft snow outside a sagging warehouse. A dark plastic path leads from the warehouse to a nearby pylon
0x1b2  /  0x25c3  : at the rim of a colossal hole, hundreds of meters in width. Stars are visible in its depths. The ice-rim is splintered and gouged as if great heavy objects have been pushed over the edge
0x1b3  /  0x262e  : on a smooth icefield, lightly dusted with powder snow
0x1b4  /  0x264c  : in a large hanger packed with stratogliders queued for launch. The doors of the first are open ready for embarkation
0x1b5  /  0x268a  : on a shuttle platform. A button protrudes from the barrier
0x1b6  /  0x26aa  : on a ladder up the pylon
0x1b7  /  0x26b6  : in the Robodome. A wide, rippled ramp leads down into the ground
0x1b8  /  0x26d6  : on a straight ramp
0x1b9  /  0x26de  : at the west corner of the cave
0x1ba  /  0x26ea  : at the north corner of the cave
0x1bb  /  0x26f7  : at the south corner
0x1bc  /  0x26fd  : at the east corner of the cave
0x1bd  /  0x270a  : at the base of a straight ramp, in the middle of a cave hacked from the ice
0x1be  /  0x272a  : in a snowrail carriage. Uncomfortable lumpy benches are moulded from the trash-strewn floor and the filthy windows are opaque. There's a "go" button
0x1bf  /  0x2780  : in the high control bubble of the Snowdozer. An engraved panel at the front of the cab has a keyhole set into it
0x1c0  /  0x27b8  : in the snowdozer's engine room
0x1c1  /  0x27c7  : 
0x1c2  /  0x27c8  : 
0x1c3  /  0x27c9  : on a significant cylindrical ledge above steps to a toroidal walkway. Transpex tubes lead away through a maze of wires and machinery
0x1c4  /  0x281b  : floating in a flexible transpex tube through the central torus of a major freezer unit. Scaled-up mechanisms are visible through the soft walls and, far below, a circular path surrounds you
0x1c5  /  0x2887  : following a winding transpex tunnel between vast lumpy metallic discs. Tiny light sources flicker far below, providing the only illumination
0x1c6  /  0x28d8  : on a toroidal walkway
0x1c7  /  0x28e5  : on a curving path in a 100m torus. A wide glassy tube spans the space above through a net of wires and pipes. A button protrudes from the floor
0x1c8  /  0x2936  : on a toroidal walkway
0x1c9  /  0x2943  : on a toroidal walkway
0x1ca  /  0x2950  : on a toroidal walkway beside a ramp. Tubes criss-cross the space above
0x1cb  /  0x2975  : on a toroidal walkway
0x1cc  /  0x2982  : in the winch room beside a pair of linedrives. A trapdoor is bolted to the low ceiling and monofibes hang down into the gloom
0x1cd  /  0x29be  : clinging to ropes in the gloom
0x1ce  /  0x29cc  : on the elevator roof
0x1cf  /  0x29d8  : in a blue glass elevator. A sliding door makes up one wall; the others are featureless apart from a panel of multi-coloured buttons. Square trapdoors show in floor and ceiling
0x1d0  /  0x2a3b  : clinging to a single rope below the elevator
0x1d1  /  0x2a51  : in a grimy pit. A rope hangs down from above
0x1d2  /  0x2a6c  : in a curving e/w corridor south of a wide entrance. A button protrudes from the floor and indicator lights decorate the ceiling
0x1d3  /  0x2ab2  : in a spotless white alcove beside a complex revival machine
0x1d4  /  0x2ad3  : in a curving east-west corridor below indicator lights
0x1d5  /  0x2af1  : in a curving e/w corridor beside a green door. Lights show above it
0x1d6  /  0x2b12  : in a curving e/w corridor beside a blue door. Lights show above it
0x1d7  /  0x2b33  : at the entrance to a blue mortuary beside indicator lights and a control panel
0x1d8  /  0x2b59  : by the entrance to a green mortuary beside lights and a panel
0x1d9  /  0x2b78  : in a blue mortuary beside a smooth ceramic slab. Lights twinkle beside a trapdoor on the ceiling
0x1da  /  0x2ba4  : in a green mortuary beside a smooth slab. Indicators illuminate a trapdoor above
0x1db  /  0x2bcc  : at the south end of a narrowing marblon cylinder. A button emerges beside an airlock door
0x1dc  /  0x2bf5  : at the north end of a widening marblon cylinder. A button pokes from the floor beside an airlock door
0x1dd  /  0x2c23  : in a wide simulated-marble tube. An immovable grill is set into the floor, and an empty padded cell can be seen between the bars
0x1de  /  0x2c6b  : in a vast smooth-surfaced cylinder beside a contoured ramp
0x1df  /  0x2c81  : standing on smooth simrock on the side of a large tube. A cyladder descends through red light
0x1e0  /  0x2cae  : standing inside a substantial smooth cylinder. A ramp leads down beside you and a similar, larger ramp is just visible opposite, across the tube
0x1e1  /  0x2cf1  : in a carpetted massage parlour hung about with red velcron drapes. The ceiling is polished to a mirror finish. A sumptuous leather couch stands in the middle of the floor
0x1e2  /  0x2d4c  : in a bare storeroom
0x1e3  /  0x2d56  : in a large low room, surrounded by lights and vids. A barely-audible high pitched humming emerges from a vast display panel with the legend "Snowball IX Freezer Control" to the south. A luminous cyladder rises through the ceiling
0x1e4  /  0x2dce  : in the southeast corner of freezer control
0x1e5  /  0x2de1  : in the northeast corner of freezer control
0x1e6  /  0x2df6  : behind the display panel. You are surrounded by the shiny warm cases of a dozen holojectors
0x1e7  /  0x2e27  : in a wood-grained library
0x1e8  /  0x2e37  : in a cramped mempak archive. Locked racks hold titles like Fusion Mechanics, Genetics by Numbers, The Last Christians, Choosing Your Small Business Android, COBOL for the Arcturan Gigabrain, Playgirl the First Hundred Years, and The Human Race and How To Win. Each pack zaps selected highlights (much better than its real contents) at your midbrain
0x1e9  /  0x2f0f  : in the condo: a small, comfortable rest area. An airbed is suspended from the ceiling
0x1ea  /  0x2f3d  : in a small tiled room. Very little space is needed to hold a wc, shower and basin but there's nothing of any game-relevance
0x1eb  /  0x2f80  : in the diner: a minute corner of the condo, equipped for eating etc. A "natural wholefood no chemicals" machine is fixed to the wall, alongside a square hole for garbage
0x1ec  /  0x2fe3  : in a cupboard
0x1ed  /  0x2fec  : in a narrow service duct, beside an aircon vent
0x1ee  /  0x3006  : in a tight e/w crawlway
0x1ef  /  0x3014  : 
0x1f0  /  0x3015  : in a dusty corner
0x1f1  /  0x301d  : on a rubbish tip. A garbage chute is supported by corroded wires far above, much too high for you to reach it
0x1f2  /  0x305d  : on a great pile of garbage
0x1f3  /  0x306c  : in an overflowing, broken junk processor (made by GIGO industries)
0x1f4  /  0x3096  : on a wide ramp to heavy plasteel door. A battery of videyes surround a notable flashing sign: "DROID-HANDLED STORE SERVICE. PRIVATE"
0x1f5  /  0x30ec  : on a gently sloping spiral ramp above a vast warehouse. Crates reach the ceiling
0x1f6  /  0x3117  : at a small counter staffed by a faceless android
0x1f7  /  0x3133  : at a wide counter staffed by a faceless android
0x1f8  /  0x314e  : in a corner, beside a red ticket machine
0x1f9  /  0x3160  : in a corner beside a green ticket machine
0x1fa  /  0x3172  : in a store room
0x1fb  /  0x3179  : in a beige, kidney-shaped entrance hall south of a buttoned airlock
0x1fc  /  0x31a0  : in a tasteful pink and green alcove beside a security door. There's a combination panel
0x1fd  /  0x31ce  : in a small round room
0x1fe  /  0x31d9  : on narrow, winding stairs leading down to an airlock iris. There is the usual floor button
0x1ff  /  0x3208  : 
0x200  /  0x3209  : in a ruined bubble farm
0x201  /  0x3216  : in an observatory. All the equipment has been systematically broken and the room is in chaos
0x202  /  0x324b  : at the base of Jacob's Ladder. A very long opaque tube, wound about with plaitted plasteel fibres, rises dead straight above you. A ladder runs up the middle
0x203  /  0x329b  : climbing Jacob's Ladder. Looking up and down, you realise it must be miles long! However, in some mysterious way, it seems easier to climb than it should
0x204  /  0x32ef  : climbing Jacob's Ladder. Although you're climbing slowly, it feels as if you're moving very rapidly..
0x205  /  0x3327  : near the top of Jacob's Ladder. Above is the light at the end of the tunnel
0x206  /  0x3344  : on a tiny platform, suspended in the middle of a colossal metallic cylinder. A yawning gulf separates the platform from a seemingly-small metallic lip round the outside. Four frail walkways join it across the abyss and a major twisted rope hangs down to support a corroded 5 klom snowball far below
0x207  /  0x33f0  : on a wide lip west of a colossal red cylinder
0x208  /  0x3403  : on a wide ledge round the north edge of a huge red cylinder. A thick ramp winds upwards, there's a tiny opening in the cylinder wall, an insubstantial bridge is suspended over the abyss below the cylinder, and if you feel tired of life there's always down..
0x209  /  0x3482  : on a wide ledge south of the abyss at the bottom of a colossal red cylinder. A 5 klom snowball hangs from a strong (!) wire down the middle of the tube. A spindly bridge joins the wire
0x20a  /  0x34e1  : on a wide ledge east of the abyss. A small hole enters the cylinder wall nearby, and a narrow bridge leads out over the abyss
0x20b  /  0x3522  : on a wide sloping ramp west of the red cylinder
0x20c  /  0x3535  : on a wide sloping ramp south of the red cylinder
0x20d  /  0x3548  : on a wide sloping ramp east of the red cylinder. Squinting up through the glare, you can make out a bunch of enormous clawhooks - each attached to a segmented wire
0x20e  /  0x35a1  : at the top of the wide ramp, north of the red cylinder. The ramp curves west through a pair of heavy blast doors
0x20f  /  0x35d2  : in a wide, dark east-west corridor terminated by blast doors to the east
0x210  /  0x35f8  : at a T-junction where the dark passage ends at a brightly lit corridor. Looks risky..
0x211  /  0x3628  : in a bright n/s corridor, at a pair of locked doors. You don't have time to explore the rooms beyond them: the important thing is to go south to the Control Room
0x212  /  0x3677  : at a junction in a north-south corridor
0x213  /  0x3686  : at the end of the corridor, beside the entrance to the control room
0x214  /  0x36a3  : beside the main instrument panel. The only control that you will ever understand (without psychomods/RNA boosts) is a red lever: "manual/autopilot"
0x215  /  0x36f9  : in a sloping crawlway
0x216  /  0x3705  : in a sloping crawlway
0x217  /  0x3711  : 
0x218  /  0x3712  : in the southwest corner of freezer control, beside a control chair. The south wall is a wavery and obscure confusion of flickery projected vids
0x219  /  0x3759  : in a comfortable cave carved into warm sandstone. Bright sunlight streams in from the east
0x21a  /  0x378a  : in a beige alcove at the rear of the cave. A small fire burns at one side, and there's a wide ledge strewn with cut meadowsweet at the other
0x21b  /  0x37d5  : in one cubicle of a great library. Thousands of people are studying at similar cubicles around, their hushed voices filling the air with a low murmuring
0x21c  /  0x382f  : in a soft, pink room. Gentle shapes move restfully across the walls to soft musical rhythms
0x21d  /  0x3864  : in a grey room, lit by flickering candles
0x21e  /  0x387b  : in a solid black room filled with a glaring white light. Despite the intensity of the illumination, you know it does not show everything clearly. Yet increasing the brightness would only dazzle: concealing more certainly
0x21f  /  0x38f8  : on a wide sunlit beach of yellow sand. Several large rocky outcrops rise up all around. Gulls call as they soar overhead
0x220  /  0x3941  : on a desert island in the middle of a sweeping coral atoll. Palm trees rise overhead: their fallen fronds forming a soft heap
0x221  /  0x398a  : in a superb recreation lounge, surrounded by a great variety of ways of passing the time: dream-games, exercisers, learndromats, fundroids etc. All are irreparably smashed
0x222  /  0x39f2  : in a sumptuous bathroom with sunken bath, jacuzzi etc.
0x223  /  0x3a15  : in a bright meadow, full of flowers and sweet grasses
0x224  /  0x3a34  : under the shade of an old apple tree. The ground is covered with thick, soft moss
0x225  /  0x3a5f  : in a forest glade (yes, really). Warm sunlight filters through the branches overhead, and cute little furry animals peer out from the undergrowth. Narrow leaf-strewn pathways lead in all directions through fragrant vegetation
0x226  /  0x3ae4  : in a snake-pit. Venomous reptiles are slithering towards you
0x227  /  0x3b06  : in an open-plan control room. As the ship flies itself there are few controls, just an assortment of computers and displays of no interest to anyone. They're decades out of date - only kept in case the modern stuff fails
0x228  /  0x3b85  : in a cylindrical airlock between two iris doors
0x229  /  0x3b9e  : in a featureless cylindrical airlock between two iris doors
0x22a  /  0x3bbf  : in a cubic airlock between two iris doors
0x22b  /  0x3bd5  : in a vertical airlock between two iris doors
0x22c  /  0x3bec  : in an ice tunnel
0x22d  /  0x3bf6  : in a tiny stratoglider. It is extensively damaged
0x22e  /  0x3c12  : in a padded room
0x22f  /  0x3c1a  : in the flexible bubble body of a spidroid
0x230  /  0x3c31  : in a vast docking bay, surrounded by piles of metallic junk. The massive exterior doors are open to space and, through them, lights are visible in the far south. A thickly knotted rope stretches into the void. At the back of the docking bay is an airlock iris with a floor button
0x231  /  0x3cc5  : in the bright, tidy docking bay of the crew habidome. An airlock iris (with button) leads further into the dome
0x232  /  0x3d00  : sitting on a plasteel container high up in the Robot Stores. More crates stretch south as far as you can see, while to the north is a revolting expanse of garbage. There's a square aperture in the wall by your head
0x233  /  0x3d77  : north of a wall of crates
0x234  /  0x3d86  : in a cramped space between crates and piles of rubbish
0x235  /  0x3da4  : on a sloping junk heap
0x236  /  0x3db1  : in a gangway between stacked cases
0x237  /  0x3dc4  : at the base of a spiral ramp, surrounded by stacked crates and containers
0x238  /  0x3de9  : in a gangway between stacked cases
0x239  /  0x3dfc  : in an aisle between stacked cases
0x23a  /  0x3e0e  : in the stores. Piles of cases stretch in all directions
0x23b  /  0x3e2b  : in an aisle between stacked cases in the stores
0x23c  /  0x3e43  : in an aisle between crates in the stores
0x23d  /  0x3e58  : in a gangway between stacked containers
0x23e  /  0x3e6f  : in a sponge-lined coffin
0x23f  /  0x3e7c  : lying on a comfortable couch
0x240  /  0x3e8c  : in a broken waldo cocoon
0x241  /  0x3e9a  : on the airbed, floating amidst warm air currents
0x242  /  0x3eb6  : in a padded cell. The walls are lined by Tuffkwilt (TM) padding, and the only door (in the ceiling) cannot be opened by you: a wide passageway is visible through its bars. A "Nutrimat" machine is the only furniture
