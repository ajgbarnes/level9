/ Location descriptions
/ ---------------------
/ Location text can be found by looking in the lords-of-time-v1-descs.txt file 
/ The code to use is 0x190 + location id
/
/ Dictionary codes
/ ----------------
/ Dictionary  text can be found by looking in the lords-of-time-v1-dict.txt file 
/ 0x01 to 0x43 - verbs e.g. say or north or wink
/ 0x44 to 0x4f - unused
/ 0x50 to 0x9f - game objects e.g. rope or sword or firefly or tin (can be put in inventory)
/ 0xa0 to 0xa0 - unused
/ 0xa1 to 0xbd - static objects that cannot be put in inventory e.g. picture, compost heap etc
/ 0xbe to 0xc8 - unused
/ 0xc9 to 0xe3 - non-player characters e.g. fairy, mammoth, tiger etc
/ 0xe4 to 0xe5 - unused
/ 0xe6 to 0xfd - other special words
/
/ Objects
/ -------
/ 1. Objects from 0x50 to 0x9f are all objects that a player
/    can pick up
/ 2. Player cannot wear objects >= 0xa1
/ 3. Player can only wear select objects < 0xa1
/
/ Description notes
/ -----------------
/ 1. Location descriptions starts at 0x190 - to get the current location's description
/    it's 0x190 + location id
/ 2. Object descrtiptions start at 0x50 - they have the same id as the object in the dictionary
/    so no conversion is required unlike for locations
/ 3. Exit description start at 0x07 - to get the exit description, 0x07 has to be added to the exit id
/    e.g. North = 0x01 but the "north" description is at 0x08 in the descriptions
/ 4. Some objects (between 0x58 and 0x74) have additional suffixed, contextual descriptions when 
/    they are in their default location e.g. valerian [hidden amongst the delphiniums] which
/    isn't shown if it's in any other location. The suffix location is 0x118 + object id so they are beteween
/    0x170 and 0x18c (although 0x18d - 0x18f could also have been used but are blank)
/  
/ Lists
/ -----
/ Memory locations below are for my BBC micro version only
/
/ list#1 - default location of objects
/          Starts at 0x1db0 + object id (min 0x50) - effectively starts at 0x1e00
/ list#2 - current working location of objects
/          Starts at 0x500 + object id (min 0x50) - effectively starts at 0x0550
/ list#3 - value of objects - either 0x00, 0x01 or 0x03. If less than 0x02,
/          not counted in the "score" command and nor does "It's a valuable 
/          treasure" get added to its description when examined
/          Starts at 0x1ef0 + object id (min 0x50) - effectively starts at 0x1f40
/        - Hit points / fight value / size of NPC - NPCs are 0xc9 to 0xe3
/          so values are from 0x1fb9 to 0x1fd3
/    
/          0x08 or greater - "Only a fool would attack..."
/          0x04 to 0x07    - "You attack ferociously, scaring off..."
/          0x00 to 0x03    - "Your blows are futile"
/ 
/          In this game on values 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09,
/          0x0a, 0x0b are used
/
/ Known variable use:
/ -------------------

/ Non-player Character (NPC) 
/ --------------------------

/ Features
/ --------
/ 
/ 1. After you first examine the picture in the first location, it's moved to
/    to the hidden location (0xff) and no longer appears in the room description
/    however you can still examine it in that location as the picture's location
/    is never checked
/ 2. Dictionary word 0x3f doesn't exist but code to process it does
/ 3. Regardless of where you are, if you drop the wheel it takes you back to the 
/    gigantic clock. This should only be from from room 0x1d6 "in a small recess
/    which sounds hollow underfoot"
/ 4. If you drop the rucksack, you don't drop the additional items you shouldn't
/    be able to carry even though the inventory limit is reduced
/ 5. Variables 0x59 to 0x62 are initialised twice
/ 6. Variables 0x64 and 0x65 are not initialised 
/ 7. The candlestick is a missing object - still has a dictionary word (0x7b) but also
/    missing description for 0x7b.  It is a scoring item in list3 which explains
/    why you cannot get 1000 points. And its default location is 0xFE so it's not
/    in-game (no code to move it).
/ 8. There's a check in the score calculation that if the score is >= 2000
/    reset it to zero. Why?
/ 9. Doesn't seem that the "tied up" (0x4e) message is ever used at code (0x1616)
/    It's based on the status indicator for the lion but the lion eats you in one
/    turn if you don't throw the net
/ 10. The "fierce lion" is in the dictionary as "LIONESS"
/ 11. At 0x0465, there's a check for the second word being "take" and if so, replaces
/     the second word with "porsche" / "car".  But the only way that piece of code is 
/     triggered is if the player types e.g. "take take <anything>" or "get get <anything>"
/     in any location
/ 12. Why reset the player's score to zero if it's greater than 2,000?
/ 13. Some weird logic at 0x0233/0x023b
/ 14. If the player types "listen" or "hear" it says "an old mattress"
/     (seems to have the wrong message code)
/ 15. The game generates "random" diagonal directions for "forwards", "backwards",
/     "left" and "right" - no logic to it... see just after 0x066e
/ 16. After lighting the petrol and jumble of wood to scare the mammoth away
/     the wood burns warmly for the rest of the game however it does not
/     stop the player from feeling cold (0x0e79)
/ 17. Used to be a "porcelain vase" (0x9e) which has a location of 0xff 
/     which is removed from game
/ 18. There is A-code logic for wearing a star but it doesn't nothing other
/     than play with var[0x65] but that's never used
/ 19. Dropping or giving away the rucksack does NOT reduce the inventory count
/     it stays at 0x0f and never reduces to 0x04. See 0x1625
/ 20. 0x22a is redundant code
/ 21. A player can't stand (and reset var[0x2e]) - they have to leave the location
/     and the A-code automatically changes them to standing
/ 22. "UNTIE" is in the dictionary twice (0x2f) and (0x3c) - second will never be matched
/ 23. Timelords will kill you if you use certain commands > 0x28 and not SIP or DRINK
/ 24. There is still code to process dictionary command id 0x3f which calls the 
/     same routine as shoot / fire (0x39)
/ 25. The wrong status is checked for the huge iron bound chest (0x109e).  If you 
/     "exam chest" and the kitchen cupboard is open then the game will state    
/     "Sorry, I can't tell you any more" rather than "It's closed".  Setting
/     var[0x3f] to 0x00 will give the correct message "It's closed" but then
/     opening the chest and examining will still say "It's closed"
/ 26. A synonym for the Android is "chain"!
/ 27. When the player is outside the sports and aerobatics area, 
/     as a hack the NPC and third word is set to the cyberman.... doesn't need
/     to be.  Could be set to the Android which is actually in that location 
/     and then the check at 0x0ae9 could be against the correct NPC
/ 28. There is an object location check against location 0x00 but no 
/     object is ever there (see 0x0af8)
/ 29. When the game starts, the first "previous matched input word" is set to
/     "look" but the previous matched word count is set to zero... why not 1?
/ 30. Code is inconsistent at times, sometimes 0x00 is used directly, other times
/     var[0x0d] is used.  Similar for 0x01 and var[0x05].
/ 31. 0x0131 to 0x014c are duplications of the previous variable initialisations
/ 32. 0x02a3 contains a check that can never be true - it's using the wrong variable
/     to figure out if the player is next to the burning wood.  Even if they are, 
/     because of this, they can die of the cold which is not the intended behaviour
/ 33. The message at 0x0ed6 that "you've already done that" if the player tries to 
/     tie the planks again, will never be displayed as it checks the state is > 0x01
/     instead of > 0x00
/ 34. If the player types "GIVE <an object> TO <any npc>" the response will always be
/     "You don't have a tiger tooth".  <an object> has to have an id of greater than 
/     0x9f e.g. clock or pendulum or wall or junk. This is because the original BBC micro v1 engine
/     (and my python engine, which follows the same logic) does a partial match against
/     TO(OTH) in the dictionary so the engine ends up with 3 words only matched i.e.
/     "GIVE TOOTH <an object>" and the actual NPC is thrown away. This can be tried with
/     e.g. GIVE WALL TO JESTER which gets translated to "GIVE TOOTH WALL" or 
/     "GIVE JUNK TO JESTER" which gets translated to "GIVE TOOTH JUNK"
/ 35. The code at 0x003 seems to be a development/testing entry point to 
/     skip initialisation and allow a known state to be set up before hand in the 
/     variables and working lists to then jump into the main game processing.  
/     The Level 9 original dev/test tools must have allowed this? 
/ 36. Colossal Cave (etc) used jump tables to route a command to its sub-routine - this changed
/     in Snowball / Lords of Time to use a giant switch table instead. Jump tables are more memory
/     efficient though.

/ NOTE so this is a bit all a bit weird... why not just use a look up table?!?
/ This game only uses it to move diagonal directions to the next but I guess it
/ works for all directions... e.g. S -> W
/
/ This sets the value of var[0x11] based on the following
/ If current direction is not set (0x00), set it to NE (0x02)

/ If current direction is SW (0x06), set it to NW (0x08)
/ If current direction is NW (0x08), set it to NE (0x02)
/
/ That would be the simple logic at least however... what it actually does is:
/
/ If 0x11 == 0 (unset) then 0x11 = 0 + 2 + 1 - 1 = 2 (NE)
/ If 0x11 == 2 (NE)    then 0x11 = 2 + 2 + 1     = 5 (SE)
/ If 0x11 == 5 (SE)    then 0x11 = 5 + 2 - 1     = 6 (SW)
