/ Location descriptions
/ ---------------------
/ Location text can be found by looking in the colossal-adventure-v1-descs.txt file 
/ The code to use is 0x64 + location id

/ Dictionary codes
/ ----------------
/ Dictionary  text can be found by looking in the colossal-adventure-v1-dict.txt file 
/
/ Note that because this game doesn't sort the matched words by dictionary id, it doesn't matter 
/ so much as in the Lords of Time where assumption are made about the order.  Sorting does make it better
/ as then you are guaranteed to have direction or verb first, then object or NPC second then NPC optionally third. 
/ They hadn't decided on that at this point but it made the code simpler in later games.
/
/ 0x01 to 0x0f - direction verbs e.g. north or across or climb
/ 0x10 to 0x22 - most other verbs e.g. fight or unlock or get
/ 0x23 to 0x23 - unusually the grate is define here as a verb (objects start next) so it can be tested against a word match
/ 0x24 to 0x43 - objects (treasure and non-treasures) e.g. sceptre or gazette or cushion
/ 0x44 to 0x44 - unusually a verb, in this instance smash/break
/ 0x45 to 0x46 - dwarves / plant NPCs
/ 0x47 to 0x47 - unusually a verb, in this instance catalogue/inventory
/ 0x48 to 0x49 - dragon / snake NPCs
/ 0x4a to 0x54 - more verbs
/ 0x55 to 0x56 - static objects (well not ones the player can pick up)
/ 0x57 to 0x5a - more verbs
/ 0x5b to 0x5b - static object (well not ones the player can pick up), door
/ 0x5c to 0x5e - more verbs

/ Object reference list
/ =====================
/
/ 1. Objects with dictionary ids from 0x24 to 0x43 are all objects that a player
/    can pick up
/ 2. Any treasures in 0x24 to 0x40 are treasures that are required to start the end game
/ 3. Treasures in 0x41 to 0x43 are higher scoring treasures but not required to start the end game
/ 4. Player cannot wear objects in this game
/ 5. The dictionary id of an object is the object id + 0x23
/
/ The A-code sometimes using the object id (obj id) and sometimes uses the dictionary id 
/ (dict id) in the table below.  All list lookups use the object id however the A-code is
/ inconsitent when checking the second word that the player input - sometimes it normalises
/ it to the object id and sometimes the value that is checked is the dictionary id.

/ Lists
/ =====
/ list#1 - door status in a location, open (0x01) or closed (0x00) (writeable) 
/          In the "exits" definitions for each location, one bit denotes if there is
/          a door in that location so a player cannot just move that way without there being 
/          a door check. All doors start "closed" however the a-code checks if they are open 
/          using this list. There can only be one door in a location too. This is also used
/          if an NPC is blocking an exit (it's treated like a door), the location exit will say there
/          is a door, the code check this list but in reality the a-code will set this to open once 
/          the NPC has been taken care of.  The same for e.g. if the player needs to set off the dynamite
/          to "open the door" when a new exit is revealed after the blast. 
/          All default to closed (0x00).
/ list#2 - initial location of objects (read only)
/ list#3 - current working location of objects - initialised by list#2
/ list#4 - indicates whether the object is a treasure (0x01) or not (0x00) (read only)
/ list#5 - indicates if an object has been seen/discovered, all initialised to undiscovered 0x00 (writeable)

/ Use of variables var[0xNN] in the A-code
/ ========================================
/ 0x01 - (Constant) 0x01
/ 0x02 - (Constant) 0x02
/ 0x03 - (Constant) 0xff, location code of the inventory
/ 0x04 - General purpose variable
/        1. Used to loop through all the objects, set their starting location etc when the game initialised
/        2. Current location of an object when performing a GET/TAKE
/        3. Used to loop through all the objects to see if in the player's inventory when peforming a INVENTORY/CATALOGUE
/        4. Holding the random number to see if the dwarf appears and throws an axe at you
/        5. Gets the current location of the vase when being dropped
/        6. Used to hold score increments along with var[0x32]
/ 0x05 - General purpose variable
/        1. Holding message ids
/        2. Calcuating part of the score
/        3. Determining if an item is a treasure
/        4. Determining if an item has been seen/discovered
/        5. Retrieving the current location of an object
/ 0x06 - (Constant) 0x00
/ 0x07 - (Constant) Unused - initialised to 0x78 (the location description for Hell)
/ 0x08 - Status of the bear in the bear room
/        0x00 - Fed and released from the chains
/        0x01 - Fed but still in the chains
/        0x02 - (Default) Unfed and still in chains
/ 0x09 - Witt's End probability of leaving - random number has to be lower than this 
/        for the player to leave Witt's End
/        0x1e - defaults to 30
/        0xb4 - if the target location is 0xfe (doesn't exist, nothing links to it) then it's 
/        set to this
/ 0x0a - True meaning of this may be lost forever however, the only place it is used 
/        is when determining the probability of whether a dwarf's knife will hit and 
/        kill a player. If a player has been resurrected (and subsequetly hasn't attacked
/        or killed a dwarf), then the probability is smaller. See 0x0197
/
/        Note - after resurrection, as soon as the player kills or attempts to kill a dwarf,
/        this gets reset to 0x01 and the probability returns to normal.
/ 
/        0x02 - default (no resurrection or attempted or otherwise dwarf kills)
/        0x01 - at least one dwarf killed or attempted to kill a dwarf
/        0x00 - player resurrected
/ 0x0b - Flag that indicates whether the player has saved the game, you lose a point
/        defaults to unsaved (0x01) and first save sets the points value to 0x00
/ 0x0c - Status of the spider.  The initial value (0xd8) is never used for anything
/        however it is the starting location of the spider.  Guess an early version of the
/        a-code used the value for the spider's location instead of list#3.
/        0x00 - dead after following the pentacle off the tower
/        0xd8 - alive and on its web
/        0xff - following the player's pentacle see 0x0e8e
/ 0x0d - Player's current location
/ 0x0e - Previous turn/commands flooding level 
/        either "up to your waist" (0x00) or "over you head" (0x01)
/ 0x0f - Current flooding level when water at the same location as the player
/        either "up to your waist" (0x00) or "over you head" (0x01). Note that 
/        this will NOT reduce if the player moves to a location that has a location location id
/        than the previous location so moving NE from where the the player blasted the
/        dynamite, won't reset this as it has a lower location id. Going West does though!
/ 0x10 - Flag to indicate that the player has reached the "east end of the Hall of Mists"
/        they are entitled to another 30 (0x1e) points for making progress this far
/ 0x11 - The number of evil little dwarves that are present
/ 0x12 - Total number of dwarves generated during the game. Used to generate the first dwarf that, 
/        when this is zero, throws the axe, misses and runs off.  After that used to generate evil little
/        dwarves (0x0071).
/ 0x13 - matched input word code 1
/ 0x14 - matched input word code 2
/ 0x15 - matched input word code 3
/ 0x16 - matched input word count
/ 0x17 - Multipurpose variable 
/        1. Player's target location (where the exit would take them) when moving
/        2. Location to move non-treasure items to in the routine at 0x09b3
/        3. Current location of an object when determining if seen/discovered
/ 0x18 - Multipurpose variable
/        1. Location to move treasure items to in the routine at 0x09b3
/        2. Caching of the player's current location and checking for an object's location against it (0x0a30)
/        3. Caching of the player's current location when moving items to it when the player says plover
/        4. Other caching of the player's current location
/ 0x19 - Used in a sub-routine to count the treasure items 
/ 0x1a - Set to 0x00 until all treasures are collected (excluding the org, sceptre and crown)
/        Needs the pearl to be discovered and then this is incremeneted every command/turn
/        When it reaches 0x06 the "CLICK. The cave is closing....." message will be printed
/        When it reaches 0x14 the elf will appear to initiate the end game
/        Continues to increment after this, can wrap around to 0x00 after 65,526 commands
/        but will stop there
/        Plugh, xyzzy and plover do not work once the end game starts i.e. value here is > 0x00

/ 0x31 - Tracks the score increment for using the dynamite
/        0x00 (0)   - Dynamite not used
/        0x14 (20)  - Dynamite detonated (+20)
/        0x64 (100) - Dynamite detonated (+20), woke up the dwarves, and roof collapses killing...dwarves (+80) but the player dies
/        0xc8 (200) - Dynamite detonated (+20) and blast collapses the celing.. killing (+180), player lives
/ 0x32 - Used to hold the score increment when calculating the player's score
/ 0x33 - contains the count of non-treasure items processed (may or may now
/        be in the player's inventory depending on value of var[0x18])
/ 0x34 - Another general purpose variable
/        Location of the lamp
/        Location of the pentacle
/ 0x35 - Used only to hold the location of the object when checking if it's in the player's inventory
/        and used to branch away if the object is not there
/ 0x36 - Next expected word in the FEE, FIE, FOE, FOO sequence
/        0x00 - player hasn't typed any of those words
/        0x01 - next expected word is FIE, player last typed any of FEE, FIE, FOE, FOO
/        0x02 - next expected word is FOE, player last typed FIE
/        0x03 - next expected word is FOO, player last typed FOE
/ 0x37 - Location of the water that seeps into the cave after the dynamite explodes 
/      - 0x00         - dynamite has not exploded yet, no explosion
/      - 0xa9         - dynamite has exploded and water is "at the north-east end of a vast cave"
/      - 0xa9 to 0xc3 - water advances every other turn trying to catch the player
/      - 0xc4         - this is a hidden location that represents the fissue, there will be 
/                       a big explosion that will kill the player if they did not lock the 
/                       heavy dungeon door. Location moves to 0xc5 on next command
/      - 0xc5         - Water does not move beyond here, when it's in this location it
/                       just stays there for the rest of the game
/ 0x38 - Water movement counter. After the dynamite explodes, this is incremented every turn starting
/        at 1.  When it reaches 3, it's reset to 1 and var[0x37] is incremented.  This means that the
/        water moves every other turn.  And it reflects the number of turns/commands water has been present
/        in its current location (max of 2)
/        
/ Notes and observations
/ ======================
/
/  1. You can say CATALOGUE instead of INVENTORY... who knew...
/  2. Player can only carry 0x04 items (0x04f5 enforces the rule)
/  3. Less likely to be hit by a dwarf's "sharp little knife" if there is only one
/     dwarf in the location
/  4. Resurrecting yourself decreases your chance of being hit by a dwarf's knife
/  5. Player can only be resurrected twice
/  6. You don't have to say "FEE" for the sequence "FEE", "FIE", "FOE", "FOO", the
/    first word can be any of those words despite the clue
/  7. If you start the sequence with any of those four words, even if you type 
/    e.g. "North" next it'll print "Get it right, dummy"
/  8. Player has a ~87.8% (31/256) chance of hitting a dwarf when throwing an axe (30/255)
/  9. The water after the dynamite explosion moves every other turn/command
/ 10. If the water is in the previous location to the player, it trickes in
/ 11. When the water reaches the fissure, it only kills the player if the heavy 
/     dungeon door is unlocked no matter where they are (it acts as a barrier
/     between the explosion at the fissure and the player). The door can only be locked
/     from the side away from the fissure.
/ 12. There's a hidden location (0xc4), the fissue, with no description
/     which is used as the fissure that's between the two locations on the east (0xc3)
/     and west banks (0xc5) - it allows the water to reach there and explode when it 
/     touches the lava. 
/ 13. Player cannot always be resurrected - any death by dynamite or the water hitting
/     the lava will I guess ruin the dungeon so they don't get the option. 
/ 14. Even though the dynamite is still in the game, you cannot blast it a second time
/ 15. Only an ~8% (21/256) chance of hearing "PLUGH" in the room with Y2 carved on the rock
/ 16. The lamp lasts 295 turns
/ 17. You can recharge the lamp after which it'll stay on indefinitely
/ 18. You won't see the lamp flicker if it's in the same location as you but not in your inventory
/ 19. The lamp starts to flicker at 260 turns/commands (turning it on counts as 1)
/ 20. Presumably at some point a single byte was used for the lamp status
/     with 0xfe / 0xff using as special values - but the lifetime of the batteries
/     was extended (maybe because colossal is bigger than adventure) and hence 
/     the code leapfrogs over the special values when the counter reaches 0xfc 
/     to continue counting at 0x100
/ 21. If you try and get the bird when you have the cage but you also have the black rod
/     the bird "flies away in total panic and flutters against the ceiling" - no idea the
/     thought process behind this
/ 22. French (non), German (nein) and Russian (niet) [modern times would anglify this as "nyet"] 
/     are accepted along with "no" (which partially matches "non" in the dictionary).  But for the 
/     positives only English words (yes/yeah/please)
/ 23. If a player types "N" to a question, it matches North (0x01) in the dictionary and has a 
/     special case to match it in the yes/no processing (0x0c4e)
/ 24. Ways to die:
/     1. Drowning by the flood (no resurrection)
/     2. Blowing yourself up with dynamite (no resurrection) by many means 
/     3. Waking the snoring dwarves with the dynamite (no resurrection)
/     4. Threatening little dwarf kills you with a a sharp little knife (resurrection possible)
/     5. Climbing a strand up the huge web when the spider is following the pentacle (resurrection not possible)
/     6. Being killed by the explosion when the water reaches the lava if the player hasn't gone beyond 
/        the heavy dungeon door and locked it (no resurrection)
/     7. Falling to the rocks below when in certain locations) (resurrection possible)
/     8. Falling into a pit in the dark ~33% chance (resurrection possible)
/     9. Crossing the rickety bridge carrying the bear (resurrection possible but the bear is removed from the game)
/    10. If the player is moving from "the passage from the east ends here..." (0x1f) to 
/        "at the east end of the Hall of Mists" (0x32) )when carrying the golden nugget (resurrection possible)
/    11. Littering in the picnic spot (0x0d) gets the player smited (resurrection possible)
/    12. Throwing the pentacle when NOT at the "top of a high stone pinnacle" (0xd1) when the 
/        spider is following the player (no resurrection)
/ 25. When you resurrect, all your items are placed in the "small brick building" apart from the 
/     lamp which is placed in the starting location " beside a small brick building" (0x01) - is 
/     that by design or a bug? Seems the latter?
/ 26. You can get from the small building to the room with the Y2 rock by saying PLUGH even
/     at the start of the game. There is no check for the gleaming pearl status. Is that a bug?
/     It's checked when going from the Y2 rock to the small building ONLY
/ 27. You can get from the small building to the room with the Y2 rock by saying XYZZY even
/     at the start of the game. There is no check for the gleaming pearl status. Is that a bug?
/     It's checked when going from the Y2 rock to the small building only
/ 28. XYZZY will only work to move between the small building and the Y2 rock until you 
/     pick up the gleaming pearl (why make it stop?)
/ 29. PLOVER will only work to move between the small building and the Y2 rock until you 
/     pick up the gleaming pearl (why make it stop?)
/ 30. Unused A-code at 0x09a6 that sets the constants
/ 31. After you kill all the snoring dwarves with the dynamite, the location description doesn't change
/     if you go back NE from the "south-west end of a vast hall...." (0xaa) to "north-east end of a vast
/     cave" (0xa9) nor does the description change in "south-west end of a vast hall...." (0xaa). Both 
/     still reference the snoring dwarves.
/ 32. If the player is in the same location as the dynamite when it explodes
/     or its in their inventory, the dwarves wake up, throw their knives and
/     kill the player.
/ 33. The bird can attack either the oriental dragon or the snake - it will kill the snake
/     but get eaten by the dragon.  The dragon can be killed with your bare hands.
/ 34. The probability of leaving Witt's End originally I think allowed a better proability if the player
/     was heading towards a specific target location.  But somewhere along the way it changed to target
/     location (0xfe) which doesn't exist and nothing links to it (see 0x03c2)
/ 35. Nice Monty Python reference if you try and feed the sandwiches to the bird "It's not hungry, just pining for the fjords "
/ 36. Player cannot try and feed the bird if it's in the player's inventory
/ 37. Waving at the shadowy figure across the canyon is a nice game feature
/ 38. It's odd that at 0x0b5f, the presence of a message on the last look is used to determine
/     if the crystal bridge is there over the wide fissure which cuts completely across the 
/     dungeon walkway".  Why not use the status in list#1 for the location?
/ 39. There are 21 locations in the "maze of twisty little passage, all different"
/ 40. Most locations in the "maze of twisty little passage, all different" do not 
/     have exits defined (only 4 locations do to take the player back to the west 
/     end of the long hall). Any direction that isn't mapped in any of this locations
/     will force a calculation of which other maze location to go to - this is derived
/     by adding the direction's dictionary id to the location id and subtracting 0x15 if it'S
/     outside of the maze to make it loop back around.
/ 41. Based on this, quickest way to the vending machine from the first location (0x92)
/     is "cross" then "southeast".  Then "north" and "up" to leave the maze.
/ 42. Part of the code is NEVER executed (0x0311 to 0x031e).  A player can be randomly 
/     taken to one of 10 locations (0x61 to 0x6a) - this seems to be a hangover from maybe 
/     an earlier design where (I guess) leaving Witt's end would randomly take you to one of these
/     locations however it's been changed to take you back to Witt's End only
/ 43. Movement NW from the "room whose walls resemble swiss cheese" to the "oriental room"    
/     is only allowed ~52% of the time (135/255)
/ 44. For scoring, treasures with an id less than 0x1d will score 5 points for being discovered/seen
/     but the high value items (sceptre/orb/crown) won't
/ 45. The player can set off the dynamite not just by typing "blast" or detonate" but also
/     "say <anything>" but this will kill the player even if the dynamite is in either the north-east end
/     or south-west end of the vast hall
/ 46. Dynamite also explodes if the player throws/hurls/lobs anything
/ 47. Dynamite also explodes if the player fights/attacks/kills/hits anything
/ 48. Dynamite also explodes if the player types plugh
/ 49. Dynamite also explodes if the player types xyzzy
/ 50. Dynamite also explodes if the player types plover
/ 51. Dynamite also explodes if the player types shazam/sesame/hocus 
/ 52. Dynamite also explodes if the player types open orb or unlock orb
/ 53. Code for processing gold/nugget (0x0e25) doesn't seem to do anything useful
/ 54. If the player has not put the treasures (with object id < 0x1c) in the "small building (0x1c)
/     when they accept the quest from the elf to free the elves, they are removed from the game
/     and will not score at the end of the game
/ 55. Endgame starts after the player picks up the glistening pearl (and they have all the minor treasures)
/     a. After the 5th turn (including the one picking up the pearl) the
/        "CLICK. The cave is closing...." message appears
/     b. After the 20th turn (including the one picking up the pearl) the
/        elf appears to force the endgame question 
/ 56. Plugh / xyzzy / plover no longer work after the end game starts (when the player picks up the
/     glistening pearl and has all the minor treasures)
/ 57. End game can only start once the player has discovered all the minor treasures (see 0x0d87)
/ 58. When saying plover in the plover room, only the pyramid and non-treasures can move with you 
/     - all other treasure items will stay behind
/ 59. The pentacle provides a source of light
/ 60. If the player is carrying both the pentacle and the lamp, it will be dark, unless the lamp
/     is switched off
/ 61. Only the first 0x6d locations have their door status initialised - no "door checks" 
/     for locations after that 
/ 62. Dwarves only appear if the player's location is between (inclusive) the "east end of the 
/     Hall of Mists" (0x31) and "the end of the "twisty passages..., all different" (0xa5) 
/ 63. There is a 1.5% (4/256) chance of a/another dwarf appearing between (inclusive) the "east end of the 
/     Hall of Mists" (0x31) and "the end of the "twisty passages..., all different" (0xa5).  
/ 64. There is a 0.7% (2/256) chance of the pirate appearing between (inclusive) the "east end of the 
/     Hall of Mists" (0x31) and "the end of the "twisty passages..., all different" (0xa5).  
/ 65. The a-code will always print "a crystal bridge spans the fissue" if the players is east 
/     or west of a wide fissure which cuts completely across the dungeon walkway (0xc3 or 0xc5).  It shouldn't 
/     but it uses a status variable (var[0x27]) that is multi-purpose mostly for displaying messages 
/     and is always positive based on the last additional description message printed.  Seems the intent
/     was maybe to have the rod waved again here? See 0x0449
/ 66. Dropping the elixir in the wrong location prints a nice message (0x05c3)
/ 67. The player needs the trident to open the clam to release the pearl
/ 68. When the clam/oyster is opened to release the pearl, the A-code "opens" the door
/     in that location "room decorated with millions of shells" (0x67) but nothing is blocking
/     the player and there is no code to process that movement.  It's only used as a flag 
/     to indicate whether the clam is open or closed - does not block any movement but maybe it did
/     in an earlier iteration, otherwise why not use a variable for the status?
/ 69. There is a redundant piece of code at 0x0551 where the if...then... can never be true
/     list#1 values can only ever be 0x00 or 0x01 and it checks against 0xff
/ 70. Quite a beautiful Easter Egg in the code - Heaven (0x13) and Hell (0x14) are defined 
/     as locations in the game. When you die, you don't know it but you are taken to "Heaven"
/     as your location (var[0x0d]) is set to 0x13. What is wonderful though is that a direction
/     is specified in the exits table to allow a player to cross from Heaven into Hell.  It's one 
/     way though! Wonder if originally the player was allowed to visit Heaven / Hell as part of
/     dying...?
/ 
/     Addr From To Dir   Inverse Door Hide MsgId
/     ---- ---- -- ----- ------- ---- ---- -----
/     04a4 013 014 Cross No      No   No   077     <--- Cross from Heaven to Hell
/     04a6 014 000   -   No      No   No   078
/ 
/     Location descriptions:
/     0x13 - You are in Heaven, sitting on a cloud and strumming a harp. It's not quite what you expected: rather boring in fact
/     0x14 - You are in Hell. The air is very hot and there is a strong stench of brimstone. It is definitely not boring, but slightly more painful than Heaven was!
/ 71. There is no door bit checking in this game in the "exits" table - all "door checking" is managed 
/     by list#1 and A-code (unlike in say Lords of Time and Snowball)
/ 72. There is no "door checking" for exits beyond locations 0x6d - all locations are assumed unblocked or handled in the A-code
/     by e.g. maze code
/ 73. The location exits blocked flag in list#1 for locations 0x20 and 0x5d seem to be set the wrong way round - when the 
/     troll leaps out they are set to 0x01 and when the troll is scared off they are set to 0x00.  This is the Inverse
/     of all other exits blocked flag usage in list#1 where 0x01 represents that the exits are unblocked.  See 0x056b, 0x63c and 
/     0x03a3.  These flags are never used / checked for this location, only the troll's status in var[0x23].
/ 74. The Colossal Cave A-code has a concept of object ids and dictionary ids.  A dictionary id for the same
/     object is the object id + 0x23.  So for Keys, the object id is 0x01 in all lists however as a word that 
/     matches in the dictionary it's referenced as 0x24.  Lords of Time and Snowball scrapped this and just used
/     the dictionary id everywhere to simplify things.
