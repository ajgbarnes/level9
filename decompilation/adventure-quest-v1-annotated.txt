/ Exit flags
/ ==========
/
/ When the "exits" command is called, exit flags are returned in var[0x48]
/ 
/ In this game they have the following definition:
/ Bit 0 - If set, the direction can be used inversely i.e. if this is 
/         an East entry between locations A and B then the player can go 
/         West from B to A
/ Bit 1 - If set this a teleporation between a black and white dot
/         so print "There is a sensation of rapid movement.."
/ BIt 2 - Not used, always set to 0x00
/ 
/ Hence if 0x00 (0b00) - cannot be used inversely but is NOT a teleportation
/       if 0x01 (0b01) - can    be used inversely but is NOT a teleportation
/       if 0x02 (0b10) - cannot be used inversely and IS a teleportation
/       if 0x03 (0b11) - can be used inversely and IS a teleportation (NEVER USED)

/ Notes and observations
/ ======================
/ 
/ 1.  The variable that holds the second word is out of sequence 
/     from the others i.e. 0x2d, 0x22, 0x2e, 0x2f. Snowball, Colossal and Lords 
/     of Time all have them in order (easier to debug)
/ 2.  When the player encounters the "Will O'Wisp", they cannot interact with it 
/     in anyway - always says "you can't get near it"
/ 3.  Will O'Wisp is misspelt in the dictionary as "whisp" and "o'whisp"
/ 4.  There is a different set of descriptions for objects when they are 
/     in the player's current location (0x105 to 0x125 ) than when in the player's 
/     inventory (0xdd to 0xfd)
/ 5.  There is a 11/256 chance of the shark attacking the player any given turn 
/     (approximately 4.2% chance)
/ 6.  Description 0x5f should be "You cannot breathe" not "...breath"
/ 7.  Description 0x5f should be "You cannot breathe" not "...breath"
/ 8.  Entering the octopus lair - there is a missning space here: "You are underwaterA huge
/     octopus leaps out and bites at your treasure"
/ 9.  Player will have an arrow fired at them when "in the centre of a magnificent cave" (0x68)
/     or "at the north of a magnificent cave with holes all around" (0x6d)
/ 10. Arrow has a 41/255 chance of hitting the player (approximately 16%)
/ 11. Visting the "ledge clinging to the west wall of a huge cavern" (0x74)
/     scares off the archer and no longer are arrows fired into the magnificant cavern
/     locations 0x68 and 0x6d
/ 12. Having the wind-bag when entering the octopus lair, gets rid of the octopus
/ 13. There is a 50/255 chance of the sheet of living flame attacking the player 
/     if they are not wearing the cloak (approximately 20% chance)
/ 14. There is a 50/255 chance of the BALROG striking out at the player 
/     (approximately 20% chance)
/ 15. If the BALROG has struck ou there is an approximately 61/255 chance
/     of the player being killed (approximately 24%)
/ 16. If the player reaches "on a ledge which clings to the west wall of a
/     large cavern" (0x75) AFTER fighting off the spider, losing the earth-stone
/     and the orc snatching it, the orcs wil kill the player here. The orcs are 
/     celebrating in the feast hall which is why the player is not attacked here
/     any more.
/ 17. The following score categories exist:
/         0 - 1,399 - A puny effort!
/     1,400 - 1,799 - Not bad.. for a beginner
/     1,800 - 3,999 - You are hereby admitted to the ranks of Adventuredom as an "Adventurer"
/     4,000 - 5,999 - You are clearly a Master Adventurer!
/     6,000+        - All Middle-Earth hails thee: "Grandmaster Adventurer!". Congratulations, 
/                     you are one of the elite who have cracked this game. 
/ 18. A player can be killed by: 
/     1. Being hit by a flame when walking around the crater
/     2. Being attacked by a shark when underwater
/     3. Being hit with the whip of flames by the BALROG
/     4. Being attacked by the pack of wolves
/     5. Inserting the wrong stone into the wrong Door of <type>
/     6. Being eaten by the gigantic worm
/     7. Being held and attacked by the skeletal hand
/     8. Unable to breathe underwater
/     9. Being attacked by the cloak of living flames
/     10.Being hit by a random arrow by the orc above "the centre of a magnificent cave" 
/     11.Being attacked by the sheet of living flame
/     12.Entering the feast hole when the orcs are celebrating after stealing the earth-stone

/     14.Being chased by the orcs and them eventually reaching the player
/     15.Being attacked by the fearsome dark shape
/     16.Being swept over the rapids and held under for a long time (without the lung-fish)
/     17.Being attacked by the huge octopus in the octopus lair when the player does not have the windbag
/     18.Being trapped for too many turns in the marsh when the gaze is locked by the reflected face
/     19.Being surrounced by the cold shadowy ghosts  
/     20.Too many turns on the bleak moor without heat (die of exposure)
/     21.Walking on the quicksand without the water walking boots
/     22.Trying to move past the giant on the track up the mountain
/     23.Being attacked by the vampire if the player has NOT eaten the garlic
/     24.Being bitten by the spider in the spider's lair if the player does not have the sword`
/     25.Dropping the ruby rather than throwing the ruby
/ 19. The BALROG only appears if the player has the sun-stone in their inventory
/     (not sure the reasoning!)
/ 20. "Altar" is spelt "alter" in location 0x92
/ 21. If the player attacks the sheet of living flame with the sword in Hell-well
/     the message "The flame vanishes into the sword! A hundred voices seem to 
/     shout in disappointment from the walls of Hell Well" is printed. Have not seen 
/     that any solutions to this game.
/ 22. BUG - the wrong door status variable is checked for the door of glass 
/     being open/closed and hence it will never print "The door is locked" for this 
/     door (it does for all others). See 0x057f
/ 23. Player has a 21/256 chance of having the skeletal hand grab them (approximately 8%)
/     in the marsh each turn
/ 24. Wolves will only appear in locations 0x01 to 0x10 (forest plus valley/gulley)
/ 25. Skeletal hand will only appear in locations 0xb0 to 0xc0 (marsh and island)
/ 26. Player has a 6/256 chance of having the pack of wolves emerge 
/     (approximately 2%) in the forest/valley/gulley locations
/ 27. var[0x47] is set at the desert locations to 0x0a but it's never used for anything
/ 28. Player has a 11/256 chance of having the shark appear when in the lake bed/quiet pool
/     (approximately 4%)
/ 29. When the player gives the emerald eye to the statue, there's a spelling mistake in the
/     response: "The status nods in thanks and gives you its rune-encrusted sword". Should be 
/     statue.
/ 30. If the player drops the stick "drop stick" in one of the following locations this
/     rather poetic message is printed: "The stick grows incredibly as it hits the ground. 
/     Buds form, leaves burst from them and drink in the light, and then the stick is a 
/     mass of flowers! Fruit quickly swells and falls onto the ground and the leaves are 
/     shed. It is just a stick again"
/     0x4c : on a ledge. It collapses, hurling you into a fast-flowing underground river! You are swept along helplessly
/     0x4d : in a raging torrent
/     0x4e  : buffeted by the swift current
/     0x4f  : swept round a bend in the river
/     0x50  : in a series of rapids
/     0x51  : on the brink of a stretch of rapids
/     0x52  : tossed around by the rapids
/ 31. Any object dropped in the above locations will wash up on the " small gravel beach to the 
/     south of a lake in a volcanic crater." (0x62)
/ 32. If an object is dropped in location "at the west end of an underwater trench. 
/     A swift current flows away through a small gap in the rocks" (0x5e) it will be
/     sucked down a hole and end up in "deadly quicksand" (0xbe)
/ 33. If the player drops any object in the rapids (0x4c to 0x52) and the fruit
/     is also in their inventory, it will be swept up onto the beach
/ 34. Whenever the "trident" (0x52) is dropped "Water bubbles from the ground" 
/ 35. The dragon will eat any object dropped in front of it when it is filling the cave
/ 36. There is a great description for the "out of game" location 0xe2 "in Purgatory. You will 
/     have to stay here for a century or two.. if you're lucky!". It's also underwater!
/ 37. Typo on the location description for location id (0x96) "iQ a very hot passage".
/ 38. Dropping the brazier always says "The brazier expands, giving out a welcome warmth"
/ 39. If the player is locked in the marsh with "A reflected face in the marsh looks back. 
/     Your gaze is locked!", dropping anything frees them (sets ripples in the water)
/ 40. Player has a 11/256 chance of being attacked by the wolves each turn after they have appeared
/ 41. When in the desert, the gigantic worm gets closer to the player whenever they move
/     location.  It gets further away if the player does anything else e.g. drop <object> or 
/     inventory or look
/ 42. If the player tries to go North from the  "at the south of a magnificent 
/     cave with holes all around. A huge door stands open behind you" (0x66) 
/     after oiling and unlocking the door, if they have at least one weapon
/     they will be blocked with ""ARMED INTRUDER! ARMED INTRUDER! ARMED INTRUDER!
/     ARMED INTRUDER! ARMED INTRUDER! ARMED INTRUDER!" yells a gargoyle overhead. 
/     The door slams"
/ 43. Orcs will start chasing the player if they cross the rope bridge whilst
/     carrying the earth-stone. This is in either direction between 
/     " on a ledge which clings to the west wall of a large cavern" (0x75) and "You are 
/     at the entrance to an orc lair" (0x77)
/ 44. The orcs will start chasing the player when they reach "on a hill-top outside a long barrow" (0xa5)
/ 45. The black dots indicate that in that direction the player will be teleported to another location
/ 46. The white dots indicate the place a player can be teleported to 
/ 47. The following teleporation location pairs exist:
/
/     Direction:   East
/     From: (0x65) south of a huge door on the north shore of the crater lake. A host 
/                  of carved stone heads glare at you from above the door, seeming
/                  to follow your every move. To the east is a second, smaller entrance, marked with a black dot
/     To:   (0x12) in the building. Steps lead down a well in the centre of the floor.
/                  A white dot is marked over the door
/
/     Direction:   North
/     From: (0x8f) in a hot room. The north door is marked with a black dot
/     To:   (0x20) on trackless desert beside a black pillar. The pillar is round, and perfectly
/                  smooth but for a single white dot half-way up
/
/     Direction:   In
/     From: (0xa5) on a hill-top outside a long barrow. The lintel 
/                  over the door of the barrow is marked with a black dot. The hill is surrounded on three sides 
/                  by sheer cliffs and from the other orcs are closing in
/     To:   (0x40) in a smelly cave: the sound of running water reverberates from the walls. 
/                  A white dot is marked 
/
/     Direction:   North
/     From: (0xc3) on a small ledge south of a small door marked with a black dot. There is a window in the wall above
/     To:   (0x61) inside an octopus lair. The water is warm and there is a white dot on the wall
/ 48. There's a bug when you try and wear/get/take/catch an NPC even if the NPC is in the same location 
/     e.g. "get wolves" will always print "You can't do thatIt's not on the ground"
/     the second half should not be printed and line 0x0e97 should probably be "Goto 0x0ec3" instead of "Goto 0x0ec1" 
/ 49. The insulating cloak cannot be picked up again after it has been laid over the hot coals (0x8e)
/     as the coals are too hot
/ 50. Feel this is bug. If the cloak is dropped in any of the following locations, the player is no longer
/     able to pick it up and will be shown the message "It's not on the ground" if they try
/     All these locations are "hot" apart from 0x90 where it says it doesn't give off heat, but for all others
/     shouldn't it say "You must be joking! Those coals are red-hot!"
/     0x8f : in a hot room. The north door is marked with a black dot
/     0x90 : in an ornate room decorated with symbols of infinity. A nest burns on a marble plinth in the centre of the room: yet it is not consumed, and neither does it give off any smoke or heat
/     0x91 : in a hot east-west corridor. To the east is a bed of glowing coals
/     0x96 : iQ a very hot passage. The floor is covered by hot coals to the west
/ 51. Player will die if they "drop" instead of "throw" the ruby
/ 52. Throwing and dropping the ruby can kill:
/     1. The unicorn in the woodland
/     2. The sphinx at the pyramid
/     3. The snakes outside the small temple
/     4. The giant up the mountain
/     5. The orcs near the snowfield / smelly cave
/     6. The fearsome shape up the spiral staircase
/     7. The abominable snowman if in the inventory or same location
/ 53. Throwing anything at the wolves scares them off
/ 54. There is no crowbar in the game however if the player tries to "unlock snowman" 
/     or "open snowman" to free the abominable snowman, the error messages says
/     "You have no keys (or crowbar)"
/ 55. Bug? The door into the "ancient house" on the "island" (0xbf) can be opened
/     and a satisfying message is printed "The bell rings and the door creaks open.
/     A gravelly voice croaks from the darkness: 'Enter.. The master awaits..'" however
/     it's unlikely anyone has ever seen this as the status var[0x4d] is NOT checked
/     when the player goes "in" to see if the door is in fact open
/ 56. Dropping the trident in a location allows the player to fill the bottle
/     with water as "Water bubbles from the ground" after the drop
/ 57. Weirdly, the following locations are allows to be used for filling the bottle
/     with water (yes they are in the marsh, maybe it's a damp house?):
/     0xc0 : in a ancient panelled entrance hall of a decaying house. Rats scurry behind the walls. There are doors to north and south
/     0xc1 : in the main hall. Steps lead upwards
/     0xc2 : in a high room. A window looks out onto the marsh to the south, and you catch a glimpse of a huge black tower nearby
/     0xc3 : on a small ledge south of a small door marked with a black dot. There is a window in the wall above
/     0xc4 : on a dark granite ramp at the foot of the BLACK TOWER
/ 58. Bug. The status of the water is mistakenly set to 0x03 when filled with water rather 
/     0x02 (0x0bae) - which is why a few checks check "< var[0x02]" (where var[0x02]
/     is the constant 0x02) or "> var[0x01]" (where var[0x01] is the constant 0x01)
/     Should be set to 0x02.
/ 59. If the player does not have the phoenix reborn, when they are frozen in 
/     front of the demon lord, the orcs will arrive in 10 turns
/ 60. Part of the player's score is made up of the highest location id they have reached
/     The highest they can reach is "on a wide ramp up the side of the Black Tower" (0xe1)
/     Which is reached before most of the end game locations 
/ 61. Player's score is calculated as:
/     1. Maximum location id reached x 8 (maxes at 225 x 8 = 1,800)
/     2. Score for staying alive (max 1,000)
/     3. Add another 900 if player has reached in the Black Tower destinations
/     "...Door of Rock..." (0xc9) to "...standing by the Bane-fire..." (0xe0)
/     4. Add 500 per <type>-stone that the player has either used on a Door of <type>
/     or is in the player's inventory.  Maximum 4 x 500 = 2000 points
/     5. Subtract the number of commands/turns entered by the player
/     6. Add 1,000 if the player completed the game and killed/banished The Demon Lord
/
/     Maximum score without subtracting the commands/turns is 6,700 
/ 
/     One published solution in the test script uses 512 turns
/
/     So maximum score is 6,188
/ 62. There is a mysterious object! There is a "compass" (0x3d) without 
/     a location description i.e. when it's on the ground so you cannot
/     see it.  However if the player types "get compass" in "You are at 
/     the top of a stone pinnacle high above the forest....." (0x19) it
/     will appear in the player's inventory as "a crystal compass 
/     enscribed 'this game Copyright (C) 1983 Level 9 Computing'. 
/     Unauthorised copying or loan is prohibited."
/ 63. Every object has two descriptions - one for the inventory and one for/
/     when it's in a location e.g.
/     Location  - An ancient medallion lies on the ground (0x109)
/     Inventory - The Medallion of Good (0xe1)
/        
/     
/ Lung-fish behaviour


/ 
/ Descriptions 
/ ============
/
/ 0xdd  to  0xfd  - object descriptions for when in the current location
/ 0xfe  to  0x104 - unused
/ 0x105  to 0x123 - object descriptions for when in the player's inventory
