0x071a  0xbc 0xbd East   Yes   No    No    0x120 You are in an east-west passage lined with large square stones, from each of which hangs a set of rusty iron manacles.

0x0720  0xbe 0xbf North  Yes   No    No    0x122 You are in long straight passage, lined with slabs of stone from which hang rusted manacles. The passage gets wider to the west.

0x0730  0xc3 0x00   -    No    No    No    0x127 You are on the east bank of a wide fissure which cuts completely across the dungeon walkway. A river of lava bubbles far below in the chasm, and foul acrid fumes rise up

0x0734  0xc5 0xc6 West   Yes   No    No    0x129 You are on the west bank of a wide fissure which cuts right across the dungeon walkway. Far below in the fissure a river of lava bubbles slowly, sending up clouds of foul acrid fumes

0x073e  0xca 0xc9 Up     Yes   No    No    0x12e You are at the bottom of the pit, in a large pentagonal room inscribed with weird symbols. The floor is caked with dried blood, scratched with complex markings. A wide stone staircase winds up from the pit towards a dim circle of light at the top of the staircase, far above

0x074c  0xd1 0x00   -    No    No    No    0x135 You are at the top of a high stone pinnacle surrounded by clouds. You look down through gaps between them and see a carpet of trees far below, stretching in all directions. To the north, the forest eventually thins into scrub as it approaches the slopes of a volcano. To the west a stream winds south along a narrow valley, and to the east the woodland continues as far as the eye can see. The staircase is the only way down
0x074e  0xd2 0xda North  Yes   No    No    0x136 You at the edge of a huge cavern which is almost filled by a huge web hanging from the centre of the ceiling. Behind you, to the west, is an exit back to the spiral staircase

0x077a  0xdb 0xdc Up     Yes   No    No    0x13f You are clinging to thick strands of sticky grey web in the middle of a huge cavern. You can either go up, further into the web, or back down to the cavern floor far below
0x077c  0xdc 0xdd West   Yes   No    No    0x140 You are on a ledge above the cavern. It was once a magnificent place, judging from the fabulous carvings jutting out of the mess. A large round passage, exactly the same size as the spider, leads west
0x077e  0xdd 0xde West   Yes   No    No    0x141 You are in the spider's lair, surrounded by thick sticky web. The stench is unbearable but fortunately there is no spider in sight. Round, narrow entrances lead east and west through the web
0x0780  0xde 0xdf West   Yes   No    No    0x142 You are in a slimy east-west passage, almost blocked by strands of thick grey web to the east. A rain of water cascades from the walls and ceiling, forming a small stream which trickles away to the west. The drip of water drowns out all other sounds
0x0782  0xdf 0xe0 West   Yes   No    No    0x143 You are in a low east-west passage beside an underground stream. Water trickles down the sides of the passage leaving brown stains and the stream is really getting quite deep

0x0790  0xe3 0x46 Up     No    No    No    0x147 You are swept along by the stream and held below the water. The current is not particularly strong, however, so you feel that you are in no danger. Fortunately your lamp seems to be waterproof
